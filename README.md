#  Road Accident Analysis – Excel Project

## Project Overview

This **Excel-based analytics project** delivers a comprehensive **road accident data analysis** using interactive dashboards, **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**, and trend visualizations.

The dashboard provides actionable insights into **accident severity**, **road conditions**, and **causal factors**, helping identify **high-risk patterns** and **areas for safety improvement**.

This project is ideal for learners and professionals interested in **data analysis**, **Excel dashboards**, and **transport safety analytics**.
